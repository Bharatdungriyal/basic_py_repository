A=int(X) + int(Y)
print(f" Here your result:-\nthe addition of X and Y is {A}.")
S=int(X)-int(Y)
print(f"the subtraciton of X and Y is {S}.")
M=int(X)*int(Y)
print(f"the multiplication of X and Y is {M}.")
D=int(X)/int(Y)
print(f"the division of X and Y is {D}.")
SQUARE=int(X)**2
print(f"the square of X is {SQUARE}.")
CUBE=int(X)**3
print(f"the CUBE of X is {CUBE}.")
Sq_root=int(X)**1/2
print(f"the square root of X is {Sq_root}.")
CUBE_root=int(X)**0.3333333333
print(f"the cube root of X is {CUBE_root}.\n thanks for using calculator.")
